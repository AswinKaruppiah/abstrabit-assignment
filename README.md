## ❓ Challenges Faced & How I Solved Them

One of the main challenges I faced was that **Supabase was completely new to me**. Initially, I wasn’t sure where to start or how to properly integrate it into the project.

I struggled with understanding how to store and manage data in Supabase. To overcome this, I followed a self-learning approach by referring to the watching YouTube tutorials and using ChatGPT to clarify concepts and resolve issues.

After successfully implementing data storage, I faced another challenge with retrieving data in real-time. I wasn’t sure how to approach real-time data fetching at first. Again through research tutorials and guidance from ChatGPT, I was able to enable real-time subscriptions and successfully implement real-time data retrieval.

Through consistent learning and experimentation, I gained a solid understanding of Supabase and successfully completed both data storage and real-time data management in the project.
