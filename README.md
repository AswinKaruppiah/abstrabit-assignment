## ❓ Challenges Faced & Solutions

### What problems did you run into and how did you solve them?

One of the main challenges I faced was that **Supabase was completely new to me**. Initially, I wasn’t sure where to start or how to properly integrate it into the project.

I especially struggled with understanding how to store and manage data in Supabase. To overcome this, I took a self-learning approach. I referred to the official documentation, watched YouTube tutorials, and used ChatGPT to clarify concepts and resolve specific issues.

Through consistent learning and experimentation, I was able to understand how Supabase works and successfully implement data storage and management in the project.
